I have been interested in completing the coding challenges from this website: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc

In the first challenge, I write a python script to build a wc tool (more info in the link above).
The python script, if run in a Unix or Windows environment, will support the command line options:
-c (outputs the number of bytes in a file), 
-l (outputs the number of lines in a file), 
-w (outputs the number of words in a file), 
-m (outputs the number of characters in a file), 
and the default option, which is the equivalent to the -c, -l and -w options.

The challenge is from this website: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc
